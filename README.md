# Lockbox

A place to put your keys. Lockbox is a centralised store for your personal SSH keys. It supports:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
- [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) and [Gitea](https://gitea.io/)
- Any `sshd` with an `AuthorizedKeysCommand` configuration directive

Written using [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/).

## Security

**Beware:** For all the systems you hook it up to, Lockbox is a [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure).
That is, if an adversary can gain control of your account on your Lockbox instance,
they can deploy their own key and access any of the linked systems.

Furthermore, the administrator of the Lockbox instance you are using is capable of adding keys under any user,
so make sure you trust the admin. (In the best-case scenario, the admin is you.)

## Usage

```
$ # set up a virtualenv, or don't, your choice. then:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cp .env.schema .env; $EDITOR .env # Set up the DATABASE_URL value
$ alembic upgrade head # Run migrations to initialise the database
$ ./run_prod.sh ./lockbox.sock # Starts a gunicorn instance (with a uvicorn worker) listening at unix:./lockbox.sock
$ # Use nginx to proxy into the socket
```

## Details

Without authentication, keys are publicised without comment fields, Ã  la GitHub's `https://github.com/<user>.keys` route.

With authentication, it is possible to access the keys with the comment field intact.

## Configuration

Configuration can be achieved via a `.env` file or through environment variables.

The configuration entries are as follows:

- `DATABASE_URL`: A connection URL for the application's database. A configuration (using SQLite) for development is included in `.env.schema`.
- `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key to sign session information with. This should be a randomly generated blob of data.
- `REGISTRATION_ENABLED`: Whether to permit arbitrary user registration.
