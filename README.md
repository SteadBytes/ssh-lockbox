## Details

Without authentication, keys are publicised without comment fields, Ã  la GitHub's `https://github.com/<user>.keys` route.

With authentication, it is possible to access the keys with the comment field intact.

## Configuration

Configuration can be achieved via a `.env` file or through environment variables.

The configuration entries are as follows:

- `DATABASE_URL`: A connection URL for the application's database. A configuration (using SQLite) for development is included in `.env.schema`.
- `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key to sign session information with. This should be a randomly generated blob of data.
- `REGISTRATION_ENABLED`: Whether to permit arbitrary user registration.
